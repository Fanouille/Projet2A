# angular-bind-html-compile
This repo contains a bower package that provides an angular directive which can be passed trusted html with angular template content to evaluate.

The `bind-html-compile` directive allows for HTML containing directives to be compiled.

You should only use this directive where the content is coming from a trusted
source.

## Install
Install via [bower](http://bower.io)

* `bower install angular-bind-html-compile`

Add dependency to your app module

* `'angular-bind-html-compile'`

## Usage 
`ng-bind-html`:
```
<div ng-bind-html="data.content"></div>
```

If the `data.content` contained a directive, it would not be compiled.

`bind-html-compile`:
```
<div bind-html-compile="data.content"></div>
```

NB: Remember to add 'angular-bind-html-compile' to app module requirements.
`app.js`:
```
var myAppModule = angular.module('myApp', ['angular-bind-html-compile']);
```
